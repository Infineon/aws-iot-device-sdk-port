# AWS IoT Device SDK Port Library

This library is a port layer implementation for the Cypress MQTT and HTTP Client libraries to work with the AWS-IoT-Device-SDK-Embedded-C library on Cypress PSoCÂ® 6 MCU connectivity-enabled platforms. These library APIs are not expected to be called by application directly. See the MQTT and HTTP Client library documentation for more details.
